# Toffeed [![No Maintenance Intended](http://unmaintained.tech/badge.svg)](http://unmaintained.tech/)

Toffeed is a wrapper for Facebook's mobile site that provides enhancements to the normal browser experience.

This repository is no longer maintained as I no longer have the time nor motivation for this project. There are a couple of forks around and [MaterialFBook by ZeeRooo](https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/apps-games/app-materialfbook-minimalist-facebook-t3477896) is a great one. Thank you so much to everyone who contributed to this project, it was an amazing learning experience for me and it helped kick my career off!
